# retro-portfolio
## about
This website is portfolio type website inspired by a windows 95 and windows 98 design style. It consists of a desktop home page with a start section leading to five different sections; about me, my favourites, contact, music, and my projects. Each of these sections open up in one window in different tabs; this window can be dragged/moved with the help of javascript.
